Still no learning yet; 
I've set-up my old PowerBook G4 with ssh/git/emacs and am finally able to run a
somewhat modern service. Maybe I should've gone with something more '97, but
maybe that's just me procrastinating learning.
Happy this set-up seems to work as is right now. It's quite surprising how this
almost 20 year old laptop still manages to have a working battery, with a cycle
count of 72.
Is that why I've never finished learning perl? Getting side-tracked too quickly?
Maybe! Oh well.

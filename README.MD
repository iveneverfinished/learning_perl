# I've never finished... Learning Perl

## Motivation
Perl always eluded me. I never had the need for Perl. I think.
I didn't have to write a website backend in the 90s, participated in code golf,
or needed anything else, Perl used to be famous for.
But there's a perl-shaped whole in my nerd-heart, that needs filling. Maybe.

Realistically, I'm just keen to see how to learn a language from a book, decades old.
Will it still be applicable in any way?


## Method of learning
The learning will be totally done offline, using only [Learning Perl, 2nd edition](https://web.archive.org/web/19980212225914/http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lperl2/) by Randal L. Schwartz and Tom Christiansen from 1997. The study method is inspired by [How to Study: A Brief Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20240324054926/https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html) by William J. Rapaport, but as this isn't a class with an exam, it'll obviously be different.
The goal for this learning is to be able to solve the [advent of code 2023](https://web.archive.org/web/20240323210132/https://adventofcode.com/2023)
after finishing the read.
